This repository provides the code for implementing the LLP-BP algorithm
described in the paper [Learning from Label Proportions: Bootstrapping
Supervised Learners via Belief Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08056).

## Abstract

Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) is a learning problem where only aggregate
level labels are available for groups of instances, called bags, during
training, and the aim is to get the best performance at the instance-level on
the test data. This setting arises in domains like advertising and medicine due
to privacy considerations. We propose a novel algorithmic framework fo√ür this
problem that iteratively performs two main steps. For the first step (Pseudo
Labeling) in every iteration, we define a Gibbs distribution over binary
instance labels that incorporates a. covariate information through the
constraint that instances with similar covariates should have similar labels and
b. the bag level aggregated label. We then use Belief Propagation (BP) to
marginalize the Gibbs distribution to obtain pseudo labels. In the second step
(Embedding Refinement), we use the pseudo labels to provide supervision for a
learner that yields a better embedding. Further, we iterate on the two steps
again by using the second step's embeddings as new covariates for the next
iteration. In the final iteration, a classifier is trained using the pseudo
labels. Our algorithm displays strong gains against several SOTA baselines (up
to 15%) for the LLP Binary Classification problem on various dataset types -
tabular and Image. We achieve these improvements with minimal computational
overhead above standard supervised learning due to Belief Propagation, for large
bag sizes, even for a million samples.
